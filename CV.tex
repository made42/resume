\addblocktext{Summary}{%
Broadly educated software engineer with experience in the banking and electronics industries. In my current role at Fairphone I supported an Android device for over 7 years, which is unprecedented in the mobile industry. I am passionate about expanding my own learning and professional development, and I am at my best when working collaboratively with others. In my off-time I enjoy reading, working out and learning to play the guitar.
